## Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added
- **Additional fields**: configurable extra MOSMIX fields are now included in every record, selected via a searchable multi-select in the edit dialog (choices sourced from the DWD MOSMIX element catalogue, `nodes/mosmix_elements.json`). Fields with an assigned conversion are converted according to the output options (temperature in °C, wind in km/h, pressure in hPa, visibility in km), all others stay unchanged; fields missing at the station are returned as `null`.
- Field codes are translated to speaking record field names via `nodes/mosmix_elements.json`; codes not listed there use the code itself as field name.
- New `msg.used_fields` dictionary describing all delivered fields (code, unit, German and English description); `unit` holds the effective unit, with `unit_original` added when a conversion was applied. New `_meta.additionalFields`, `_meta.additionalFieldsSkipped` and `_meta.additionalFieldsNotAvailable` for transparency.
- New `msg.fields_not_found` dictionary (same structure as `used_fields`) listing requested fields with no data in the current time window; such fields are omitted from the records entirely (partially available fields remain with `null` gaps). `used_fields` itself only contains actually delivered fields.
- New record field `dewPoint` (from MOSMIX `Td`, respecting the °C setting).
- New record field `type` classifying each timestamp as `past`, `current` (first step at or after now) or `forecast`.
- HTTP endpoint `GET /mosmix-elements` serves the MOSMIX element catalogue to the editor.
- Unit tests (`node --test`, run via `npm test`) and a standalone smoke test (`tools/smoke-test.js`).

### Changed
- Record assembly now works from a single resolved field list (standard fields plus additional fields, de-duplicated); the existing standard field semantics (unit conversions, derived `relHumidity`, `precipitationText`) are unchanged.
- Core-only mode keeps additionally configured fields instead of dropping them.

## [1.4.1] – 2025-11-26

### Added
- Introduced fully localised precipitation description (`precipitationText`) with dynamic interpolation for intensity and value.
- Added new i18n keys for precipitation intensity levels (`precipIntensityLight`, `precipIntensityModerate`, `precipIntensityHeavy`) in all locale files.

### Changed
- Moved help text into dedicated, language-specific HTML files under `nodes/locales/<lang>/` according to official Node-RED i18n guidelines.
- Centralised runtime translation helper (`t()`) at module level for consistent access across all functions.
- Standardised interpolation syntax to `__variable__` for full compatibility with Node-RED’s i18n engine.
- Unified i18n key structure to align with conventions used across the updated DWD node family.

### Fixed
- Corrected missing precipitation translation caused by non-interpolated placeholders.
- Fixed a runtime error (`t is not defined`) by adjusting the translation helper scope.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-11-16
### Added
- Fully rewritten **English README** in modern structure (consistent with entire DWD node family)
- Updated and standardised **example flow** (`examples/weatherforecast-basic.json`)
- Added detailed installation instructions (including Palette Manager guidance)

### Changed
- Documentation structure unified across all DWD-related nodes (Pollen, Forecast, Warnings, Rainradar)
- Improved i18n descriptions and clarified how translator files are organised
- Refined configuration explanations (station ID, source URL, unit conversions, wind direction modes)
- Cleanup and modernisation of help text references

### Fixed
- Removed outdated documentation sections
- Minor markdown formatting corrections

### CI
- Automatically mark `-beta`, `-alpha` and `-rc` tags as **GitHub pre-releases**.

## [1.3.1] - 2025-11-15
### Fixed
- Release workflow corrected

## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-15
### Added
- Full internationalization (i18n) support for all UI elements.
  - Runtime messages localized via `RED._(...)`.
  - Editor UI now supports multi-language labels using `data-i18n`.
  - Help text moved to per-language files:
      - `nodes/locales/en-US/<node>.html`
      - `nodes/locales/de/<node>.html`
  - Automatic language switching based on Node-RED editor settings
    (“Browser”, “Deutsch”, “English”).

### Changed
- Updated internal structure to use the official Node-RED i18n layout:
    - `nodes/locales/<lang>/<node>.json`
    - `nodes/locales/<lang>/<node>.html`
  - Simplified template HTML by removing inline help text.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-11-06
### Docs
- Unified README style and structure with other DWD modules for consistent documentation.

## [1.2.0] – 2025-11-05
### Added
- Option **“Wind direction as text”** (`windDirMode`) in the UI with three modes:  
  `deg` (default, degrees only), `8` (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW), `16` (N, NNE, NE, …).  
  For `8`/`16`, in addition to `windDir` (°), the field **`windDirCardinal`** is output in the payload.
- `_meta.windDirMode` reflects the selected setting.

### Changed
- No breaking changes. Default behavior remains unchanged (`deg`).

### Migration
- No actions required. Flows continue to work unchanged.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-11-02
### Fixed
- **Station name:** automatically read from `<kml:name>` or `<kml:description>`

## [1.1.1] - 2025-11-02
### Added
- **Filter “Only future timestamps”**: removes past timestamps before the optional hour limit applies.
- Optional **stale fallback**: sends the last successful response in case of errors, if enabled.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-02
### Added
- Fallback calculation of relative humidity from `TTT` (temp) and `Td` (dew point) if `rH/RELH` is not included in the MOSMIX-KML.

### Fixed
- More robust KML parser strategy (Placemark/ExtendedData, dwd:Forecast, regex fallback) to reliably find parameters.
- The limitation of the forecast to `hoursAhead` (lead time) is now correctly applied.
- Various diagnostic logs added to detect future parsing issues more quickly.

### Changed
- Consistent normalization and safe unit conversion (°C, km/h, hPa, km).

## [1.0.9] - 2025-11-01
### Fixed
- Parser error “Unexpected token ':'” in `dwd-weatherforecast.js` fixed
  (incorrect access to `dwd:ProductDefinition`).

## [1.0.8] - 2025-10-30
### Changed
- Release process improved:
    - New script `scripts/ensure-changelog.js` automatically checks on version bump whether `CHANGELOG.md` was changed and staged.
    - New `preversion`, `version` and `postversion` hooks in `package.json` for consistent commits and automatic push.
- `package.json` extended with release scripts and build process optimized.
- No functional changes to the Node code itself.

## [1.0.7] - 2025-10-30
